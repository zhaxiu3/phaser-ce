For problems with your own code, please post in the [Phaser 2 forum](https://phaser.discourse.group/c/phaser2) or [Slack](https://phaser.io/community/slack).

API errors must include example code showing what happens, and why you don't believe this is the expected behavior. Issues posted without code take _far_ longer to get resolved, _if ever_.

You can use the [Phaser CE game template](http://codepen.io/pen?template=vyKJvw) or any another service to demonstrate the issue. If we can run it and see the error, we can usually fix it.

If your Issue contains _any_ form of hostility it will be instantly closed.

**Be nice. We do this for free.**
